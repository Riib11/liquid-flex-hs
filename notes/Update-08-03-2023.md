# Update 08-03-2023

Last week, I had just figured out how use the liquid fixpoint interface. I was
able to feed it terms/types (annotated with refinements, which were turned into
liquid fixpoint expressions via embedding) from a simple language I made for
testing, and get it to refinement-check.

This week, I plugged that functionality into the rest of the Flex pipeline,
yielding a small collection of end-to-end tests that demonstrate how refinement
type-checking works on term/types. This took a lot of work, and its clear now
that I have to interface with liquid fixpoint, I needed to shuffle around a few
abstractions, and a __refactor__ is very much needed. For the simple deliverable
prototype, I suspect that I won't need to actually do the refactor, but if the
prototype wants to be built upon in the future then a refactor is definitely
needed right away.

The immediate next things to do are:
- refinement-checking the relevant declarations: functions, constants
- implement handling of newtypes/structures, which can have refinements
- handle type casting around polymorphic primitive operators e.g. +, /, some,
  none, etc.
- figure out totality checking with liquid fixpoint

The less important things that need to be done eventually are:
- inlining (non-transform) function calls in refinements
- decide how to handle floating-point numbers in the context of
  refinement-checking
- make sure that implicit parameters are handled properly through type-checking
  and translating
