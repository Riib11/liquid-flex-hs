# Update 2023-03-22

The main developments are:
- Refinement-checking is implemented for
  - all base types (intN, floatN, bit, char, string)
  - tuples, which involved using Liquid Fixpoint's interface to polymorphism
    (since the component types of the tuple can have refined types)
  - structures, which involves dynamically generating Liquid Fixpoint data
    declarations using the input Flex module
- Small automated test suite (small, but still covers all the basic
  capabilities) for:
  - parsing
  - typing
  - refining (prototypical, only covers currently-implemented cases)
- Major overhaul of the syntax and typing to clean up some clutter that
  accumulated over time as my understanding of Flex matured -- which is now
  codified in the Flex.md document that I shared on Mattermost last week and
  have modified since with the feedback from Ben and Zach. Unfortunately, the
  interpreted and REPL implementation fell into deprecation during this process,
  but I think at this point I'll just wait till I have everything else working
  so I know better what to hae in mind when building a minimalist interface for
  that.

Building up to and then then consistently using the Liquid Fixpoint interface to
datatypes took longer than I expect, which is why I only have tuples and
structures so far. But, I chose these two specifically because they required the
main capabilities that will be immediately transferable to implementing the
other kinds of data types: 
  - polymorphic refined types (which are used by tuples, arrays, and options)
  - dynamic generation of Liquid Fixpoint data declarations, which requires
    making sure that several different kinds of symbols are generated and used
    properly

In brief, this is the strategy for refinining, since I didn't get to explain it
fully yet in our meetings:
  - The "base" syntax is the syntax that corresponds to input programs the user
    writes. After typing, the base AST is annotated with all relevant types.
  - The "refined" syntax is simplified syntax that assumes well-typedness and
    contains only the information that is relevant to refining (e.g. it doesn't
    remember explicit vs implicit arguments, since these are all instantiated
    after typing)
  - Refining involves these phases:
    1. "Translate" the typed base program into a refined program with trivial
       refinements.
    2. Introduce the relevant declarations into context.
      - structures, newtypes, enums, variants yield data declarations
      - transforms yield uninterpreted functions
      - functions are preserved, as they will be inlined at their respective
        applications
    3. Refinement-check each transform and constant, involving a traversal that
       annotates with discovered refinements.
      - A term is checked to satisfy an expected refined type be synthesizing
        the most specific refined type that the term satisfies, and then
        checking if that refined type is a subtype of the expected refined type
        (see the figure below for the corresponding inference rule)

          G |- { x: a | P(x) }
          forall x: a. P(x) => Q(x)
        -------------------------------------
          G |- { x: a | P(x) } <: { y: a | Q(y) }

      - The hypothesis of this rule is yielded as a constraint (encoded with
        Horn Clauses), which is propogated outwards to the top check for the
        declaration. Then, this constraint is handed off to Liquid Fixpoint's
        interface to the SMT solver (along with the appropriate quantifications
        introduced in step 2, and parameters if the checked term was the body of
        a transform)
      - Some notable special cases:
        - A function `f(x: A) -> B { b }` is inlined at `f(a)` as `let x' = a in
          b[x := x']` where `x'` is a fresh version of `x`
        - A structure construction `S { x = a; y = b }` also induces the
          constraint that `let x = a; let y = b; assert(P(x, y))` where `P(x,
          y)` is the user refinement on structure `S`

My main goals for next week are:
- Refining implemented for all the different kinds of data implemented
- Refining implemented for pattern matching 
  - There is a Liquid Fixpoint interface to this that works with its interface
    to datatypes, but I'm not sure if/how it deals with totality checking
- Refinement test suite that covers all basic capabilities
