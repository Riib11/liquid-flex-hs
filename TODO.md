# TODO

To get refinement type checking working with at least base types (e.g. just `int*` types):
- [ ] some primitive functions in Flex
- [ ] syntax translation: Flex -> Liquid Flex
    - [ ] handle Structures and Newtypes
    - [ ] handle function implicit parameters
- [ ] examples/tests for translation
    - [x] literals
    - [x] simple applications (no implicit parameters)
